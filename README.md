# 2048 Game

Welcome to the **2048 Game**!
This repository contains a clean and optimized implementation of the classic 2048 puzzle game using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game is responsive and easy to play directly in the browser.

---

## 🧩 About the Game

2048 is a sliding tile puzzle game where the objective is to merge tiles with the same value to eventually reach the number `2048`. Each move spawns a new tile with the value `2` or `4`. The game ends when no more valid moves are possible.

---

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to slide the tiles:
   - **Arrow Up**: Move tiles up.
   - **Arrow Down**: Move tiles down.
   - **Arrow Left**: Move tiles left.
   - **Arrow Right**: Move tiles right.
2. When two tiles with the same value collide, they merge into one (e.g., `2 + 2 = 4`).
3. Try to reach the tile with the number `2048`!

## 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Smooth tile movements and merges.
- **Color Coded Tiles:** Each tile value has its own color for better visibility.
- **Win and Lose Conditions:** Alerts you when you win or lose.
- **Optimized Code:** Uses a matrix representation for improved performance and maintainability.
- **Responsive Design:** Works well on both desktop and mobile browsers.
